I'm a full stack web engineer who spends his time learning as much as I can about web development and other interesting things. I also like playing guitar, video games, and spending time with my fiance√®.

You can see some cool stuff I do on [GitHub](http://github.com/justinkambic)

If you see any typos or other issues with this site, I'd be super appreciative if you'd file an issue on its [repo](https://github.com/justinkambic/justinkambic.github.io/issues).
